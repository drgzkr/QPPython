# QPPython
Python implementation of the core functionality of;

**QPPLab: A generally applicable software package for detecting, analyzing, 
and visualizing large-scale quasiperiodic spatiotemporal patterns (QPPs) of brain activity**

Aside from having been written in Matlab, the original package enforces a lot of custom data structures both for inputs and outputs. This one does not.
We also made what we believe to be some improvements on the algorithm (e.g. better sliding window implementations requiring less memory).

# WhateverOurMethodsNameIs
Alongside the QPP implementation, should we use this repository to host the code for our project too?
Naming the possible package that would host our method QPPython might not be a good idea?
